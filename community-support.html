        <h1>COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h1>
        <p><strong>Support when it matters most</strong></p>
        <p>In the event of a member’s death, Anidaso may provide a community support payment to the member’s nominated next of kin, subject to eligibility and governance review.</p>
        <p>Community support:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is intended to assist families during a difficult and emotional time</li>
          <li>Is provided in a dignified and respectful manner</li>
          <li>Is subject to a minimum active membership period</li>
          <li>Requires verification and review by the governing committee</li>
          <li>Is dependent on fund sustainability at the time of the request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anidaso operates as a community-led family protection fund and not an insurance scheme. Community support payments are discretionary and are not guaranteed. This approach helps protect the long-term stability of the fund and the interests of all members.</p>
